# GoDefer

A Rust `no_std` implementation of [Go's `defer` statement](https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/12), which executes a block of code when the surrounding scope ends.

## Usage

Add the dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
godefer = "1.0.0"
```

## Examples

Simplest example:

```rust
use godefer::defer;

fn main() {
    defer! { println!("Second"); }
    println!("First");
}
```

Multiple statements:

```rust
use godefer::defer;

fn main() {
    defer! {
        println!("Second");
        println!("Third");
    }
    println!("First");
}
```

In Go, the `defer` code runs when the function exits. In this Rust implementation, the code runs when the surrounding scope ends â€“ this makes it possible to use `defer` inside loops:

```rust
use godefer::defer;

fn main() {
    defer! { println!("End"); }
    println!("Before");

    for i in 0..2 {
        defer! { println!("Defer {}", i); }
        println!("Loop {}", i);
    }

    println!("After");
}
```
